        The commit #{commit.sha} `#{commit.message}` is too long. Please adhere \
        to the following basic structural rules for creating a meaningful \
        commit message:        * Keep the first line of your commit message short (not more than 50 chars). \
          Many tools such as Github and graphical git clients strip the subject after \
          50 characters, and people working on the command line are better off with \
          text which is not too wide.
        * Keep the second line empty
        * Use the rest of the commit message to describe the commit. Thereâ€™s no \
          restriction on the format nor the length, so be as descriptive and \
          informative as possible.
